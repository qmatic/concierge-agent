This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started running this project on your local machine for,
1. Development
    1. Orchestra Installed on your local machine
    2. Orchestra Installed on a remote machine
2. Creating the Development Build
3. Creating the Production Build

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed 
1. Node 10 or above. `https://nodejs.org/`

## Development

1. Clone the project
2. Run the following command to install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Development server

If you have orchestra installed locally running on port 8080 run ```npm start``` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 
If you are working towards a remote orchestra you have to reconfigure the proxy config. You can use your own proxy.config.json like in the case of the script "startlocal" (package.json -> scripts). Create your own proxy.config.json using the proxy.config.json as a template and replace the targets.
You can find available npm commands in package.json under "scripts".
Use them by running ```npm run <your-command>```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Development Build

Run `npm run build-war-dev` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

* Copy the war package from **dist\webapp** to **orchestra\system\custdeploy** in your system
* Then copy the translation entries file from **dist\webapp** to **orchestra\system\conf\lang** in your system

## Production Build (Create war file)

Run `npm run build-artifactory` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

The build number is taken from `src/app.json`
